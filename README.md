# Playlist Static Comp Challenge

## Specification

This static comp challenge will keep you exercising that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate the image below by recreating the screenshot using HTML and CSS.

Don't worry, we'll give you a bit of flexibility, however the objective is to build something that **very closely** represents the original design.

Once you get into the workforce, building out comps that reflect the designer's choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

### Things to Note

 - We have not provided you with any assets, nor native files. You will have to source assets on your own per the creative license guidelines below.

### Creative License

You may NOT take liberties with the layout, but your creative license includes:

* Text
* Images
* Icons
* Color palette, but ONLY if you select a complementary palette. We highly encourage you to visit sites like:
  - [material palette](https://www.materialpalette.com/)
  - [coolors](https://coolors.co/)
  - [color-hex](http://www.color-hex.com/color-palettes/)

### Base Requirements

  - Basic static site setup with `index.html` and `styles.css`
  - Submit your work through a PR
